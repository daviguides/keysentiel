# Security Philosophy

KeySentinel is based on **Zero Trust Principles**:

- If it's **not encrypted**, it's **exposed**.
- If it's **on disk**, it's **compromised**.

**Features:**
- Local symmetric encryption (Fernet)
- Secure clipboard handling
- Auto-clear memory after operations
- No plaintext exports (blocked by design)

> "Defense is built through discipline, not convenience."
